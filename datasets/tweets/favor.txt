95744	Legalization of Abortion	BREAKING: On a 58-35 vote, the Ohio House votes to approve a six-week abortion ban, which would become the most extreme ban in the country. The bill moves to the Ohio Senate.  EMAIL YOUR OHIO LAWMAKERS:  #StopTheBans 	FAVOR

10726	Legalization of Abortion	She's voting against the bill because it does not consider the mental health of what it would put that girl through. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
29825	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Kristin @XYZ is sharing the story of a 14 year old girl who was pregnant from rape at the hands of her family. This abortion ban completely abandons girls who are victims. #StopTheBans	FAVOR

66176	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Kristin @XYZ says "Motherhood should never be forced upon anyone." This abortion ban is not in the best interest of people not ready to become parents. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR

45602	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. (and Senator-Elect!) @XYZ opposes this abortion ban. She says she's working to find solutions that help all of Ohio's 11 million citizens. She says the legislature can't know what they're all going through. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
47616	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Ron Hood is speaking in defense of the six-week abortion ban. He has separate legislation that would ACTUALLY APPLY THE DEATH PENALTY to women or physicians after an abortion. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
28640	Legalization of Abortion	The House is back in order. They're doing a re-vote to reconsider Rep. Hagan's initial amendment. The amendment is again adopted. We have not yet seen that language. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
70720	Legalization of Abortion	There are no exceptions in the bill for rape, incest, or to protect the health of the woman. This bill would criminalize doctors who perform abortion procedures. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR

58432	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Hagan asks people to support her abortion ban, whether Republican, Democrat, or Independent. She's ignoring the 7 in 10 Americans who want to see abortion access preserved and protected. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
61953	Legalization of Abortion	Term limited Rep. Hagan is hoping Gov. Kasich will reverse his previous veto of her unconstitutional abortion ban. She wants to block the 20,000 Ohioans who choose to have an abortion each year. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
69792	Legalization of Abortion	Anti-abortion ideologues should not attempt to insert politics between a patient and their physician. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
87523	Legalization of Abortion	No political maneuvering makes an abortion ban acceptable. Once a woman has made the decision to end a pregnancy, she needs access to safe, legal abortion care in her community. The decision to have an abortion is not a political decision. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
81633	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Hagan took over control of the bill in 2014 after it was rejected by the Ohio House. She's been working to repair damage to the proposal done by activist group Faith2Action. They insulted any Republican who wouldn't move the ban. #StopTheBans	FAVOR

29825	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Kristin @XYZ is sharing the story of a 14 year old girl who was pregnant from rape at the hands of her family. This abortion ban completely abandons girls who are victims. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
04256	Legalization of Abortion	She notes that the bill does not include exceptions for mental health of women who are sexual assault survivors. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
66176	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Kristin @XYZ says "Motherhood should never be forced upon anyone." This abortion ban is not in the best interest of people not ready to become parents. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR

73894	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. @XYZ says many domestic violence situations involve perpetuators sabotaging birth control and denying victims access to abortion options. She's fighting to help those survivors. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
72096	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Antonio adds that the bill doesn't include exceptions for rape or incest, blocking abortion before survivors of sexual assault know they're pregnant. She says women "should not be forced to carry a rapist's child." #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
45602	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. (and Senator-Elect!) @XYZ opposes this abortion ban. She says she's working to find solutions that help all of Ohio's 11 million citizens. She says the legislature can't know what they're all going through. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
47616	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Ron Hood is speaking in defense of the six-week abortion ban. He has separate legislation that would ACTUALLY APPLY THE DEATH PENALTY to women or physicians after an abortion. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
28640	Legalization of Abortion	The House is back in order. They're doing a re-vote to reconsider Rep. Hagan's initial amendment. The amendment is again adopted. We have not yet seen that language. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
70720	Legalization of Abortion	There are no exceptions in the bill for rape, incest, or to protect the health of the woman. This bill would criminalize doctors who perform abortion procedures. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
99072	Legalization of Abortion	The unconstitutional six-week abortion ban would block access to safe and legal abortion before most women even know they‚Äôre pregnant. #StopTheBans	FAVOR

59490	Legalization of Abortion	This bill would effectively outlaw abortion and criminalize physicians. Banning women from getting a medical procedure is dangerous, out of touch with Ohio values, and is completely unacceptable. #StopTheBans	FAVOR

58432	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Hagan asks people to support her abortion ban, whether Republican, Democrat, or Independent. She's ignoring the 7 in 10 Americans who want to see abortion access preserved and protected. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
61953	Legalization of Abortion	Term limited Rep. Hagan is hoping Gov. Kasich will reverse his previous veto of her unconstitutional abortion ban. She wants to block the 20,000 Ohioans who choose to have an abortion each year. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
69792	Legalization of Abortion	Anti-abortion ideologues should not attempt to insert politics between a patient and their physician. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
87523	Legalization of Abortion	No political maneuvering makes an abortion ban acceptable. Once a woman has made the decision to end a pregnancy, she needs access to safe, legal abortion care in her community. The decision to have an abortion is not a political decision. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
81633	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Hagan took over control of the bill in 2014 after it was rejected by the Ohio House. She's been working to repair damage to the proposal done by activist group Faith2Action. They insulted any Republican who wouldn't move the ban. #StopTheBans	FAVOR

70720	Legalization of Abortion	There are no exceptions in the bill for rape, incest, or to protect the health of the woman. This bill would criminalize doctors who perform abortion procedures. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
99072	Legalization of Abortion	The unconstitutional six-week abortion ban would block access to safe and legal abortion before most women even know they‚Äôre pregnant. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
35136	Legalization of Abortion	Over twenty-thousand people choose to have an abortion in Ohio each year, and seven in ten Americans support legal access to abortion care. Email your Ohio lawmakers in support of abortion patients:  #StopTheBans	FAVOR
59490	Legalization of Abortion	This bill would effectively outlaw abortion and criminalize physicians. Banning women from getting a medical procedure is dangerous, out of touch with Ohio values, and is completely unacceptable. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
82656	Legalization of Abortion	The Ohio House is taking a 10-15 minutes recess to discuss the legislation in caucus. #StopTheBans While you wait, email your legislators here:  Or look them up and call:  	FAVOR
30787	Legalization of Abortion	Ohioans across the room and across the state are in opposition to this abortion ban. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
24512	Legalization of Abortion	This abortion ban would block patients from the care they need and deserve. If enacted, this legislation would worsen the reproductive health care crisis in our state. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
58432	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Hagan asks people to support her abortion ban, whether Republican, Democrat, or Independent. She's ignoring the 7 in 10 Americans who want to see abortion access preserved and protected. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
61953	Legalization of Abortion	Term limited Rep. Hagan is hoping Gov. Kasich will reverse his previous veto of her unconstitutional abortion ban. She wants to block the 20,000 Ohioans who choose to have an abortion each year. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
69792	Legalization of Abortion	Anti-abortion ideologues should not attempt to insert politics between a patient and their physician. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
87523	Legalization of Abortion	No political maneuvering makes an abortion ban acceptable. Once a woman has made the decision to end a pregnancy, she needs access to safe, legal abortion care in her community. The decision to have an abortion is not a political decision. #StopTheBans 	FAVOR
81633	Legalization of Abortion	Rep. Hagan took over control of the bill in 2014 after it was rejected by the Ohio House. She's been working to repair damage to the proposal done by activist group Faith2Action. They insulted any Republican who wouldn't move the ban. #StopTheBans	FAVOR
